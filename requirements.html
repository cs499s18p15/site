      Interactive "wallchart" front-end web application that pulls project
      information from a project database and displays it accurately. Users 
      can create project elements of three separate project types and edit 
      their information and column on the chart.
      <p style="font-style:italic;">(essential)</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      The front-end sends user submitted changes to back-end which then 
      updates the database and changes the information displayed to
      all users. The database will include all information about each
      project including the title, description, stage/status, etc.

      Users can create accounts with display names to edit projects. The 
      application should show who updated what.
