  <h1>Noah's Weekly Updates</h1><br>
  
  <h2>UPDATE: Feb. 18, 2018</h2>
  <p>Completed Ruby script to populate the mongodb database with arbitrary
    data consisting of three collections-- projects, columns, and users. With
    the project collection consisting of 20 randomized project documents, the 
    columns collection having the three standard columns for the chart, and two
    users. This will allow us to easily create the database for testing locally
    on any of the team members' or customers' machines. This will also allow us
    to test varying the amount of projects, columns, and users to ensure this 
    functionality works. I also started to update the Effort and size estimation,
    Schedule and milestones, and Platforms, tools, and languages sections of the 
    requirements page for the project progress website.</p>

  <h2>Feb. 8, 2018</h2>
  <p>I worked on a Ruby script to populate the mongodb database with random
    projects and their data. This will be useful for testing the tool to ensure
    the back-end and front-end are communicating properly with the project data, 
    since we do not have any users to create/update projects.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 7, 2018</h2>
  <p>I updated this progress site's introduction and requirements pages. This includes
    the introduction to the project and the requirements listed in priority order based
    on the necessary requirements provided on the course web page.</p>
