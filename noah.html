  <h1>Noah's Weekly Updates</h1><br>
    
  <h2>UPDATE: Mar. 4, 2018</h2>
  <p>We met with Toyota this past week and were told we would need to change
    our database. This will mean our project's front-end progress has stopped
    and we are all hands on deck on migrating to a different database. Toyota
    gave us a choice between MS SQL (greatly preferred), MySQL, and PostreSQL. 
    We have come to a mutual decision that MySQL will likely be the best option 
    because three team members (myself included) will not be able to locally 
    run the version of the MS SQL server Toyota uses, due to having Macbooks.
    We still need to get the go-ahead from our customer contact, we were unable
    to have our weekly meet with him this past Thursday because he was out sick.
    Beyond researching our database options and how to migrate our project to 
    a new one, I also began to update the user scenarios section for this 
    progress site. I also added a some of the nodemailer package functionality 
    in order to send registering users a confirmation email. This feature's 
    progress has now been temporarily halted because of the database issue.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 25, 2018</h2>
  <p>Updated mongodb database populater script to create a dummy 'teams'
    collection of data. This means there are now four separate collections.
    I also updated this script to add a few more necessary attributes to each 
    of the collection types in the database. This week I also completed the 
    effort and size estimation for this progress site as defined for the 
    requirements section of the final report. Lastly, I began research on the
    user password reset functionality for the project. This includes researching 
    and looking at examples of two popular node.js packages-- sendemail and 
    nodemailer. One of these should provide the functionality we seek.</p> 
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 18, 2018</h2>
  <p>Completed Ruby script to populate the mongodb database with arbitrary
    data consisting of three collections-- projects, columns, and users. With
    the project collection consisting of 20 randomized project documents, the 
    columns collection having the three standard columns for the chart, and two
    users. This will allow us to easily create the database for testing locally
    on any of the team members' or customers' machines. This will also allow us
    to test varying the amount of projects, columns, and users to ensure this 
    functionality works. I also started to update the Effort and size estimation,
    Schedule and milestones, and Platforms, tools, and languages sections of the 
    requirements page for the project progress website.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 8, 2018</h2>
  <p>I worked on a Ruby script to populate the mongodb database with random
    projects and their data. This will be useful for testing the tool to ensure
    the back-end and front-end are communicating properly with the project data, 
    since we do not have any users to create/update projects.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 7, 2018</h2>
  <p>I updated this progress site's introduction and requirements pages. This includes
    the introduction to the project and the requirements listed in priority order based
    on the necessary requirements provided on the course web page.</p>
