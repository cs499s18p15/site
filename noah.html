  <h1>Noah's Weekly Updates</h1><br>
    
  <h2>UPDATE: Apr. 8, 2018</h2>
  <p>This past week I finished the back-end route work for the password reset
    feature. This involved generating a key that was sent to the requesting
    user via email. This key was added to a database along with the user's 
    ID number and email, and a timestamp to ensure the key's validity for no
    more than 24 hours. This will allow the back-end to verify that the key 
    exists and is valid and therefore allowing the password to be reset in
    the database. In addition to this, I wrote the SQL to create the table
    called 'reset' to store the aforementioned information. A second bit of
    functionality I started and finished this week was the 'project complete'
    feature. This allows team members to mark an existing project as complete,
    which effectively removes the project from the wallchart display, however
    the project remains in the database. This involved adding a column called
    'complete' to the projects table of the database which stores a value of 
    type BOOLEAN to indicate whether the project has been completed or not and 
    also adding a route to update that attribute in the MySQL projects table. 
    This means when a user presses the complete button in the project inspector, 
    the project will "disappear" from the wallchart display. In addition, I changed
    the 'get' route in projects.js to ensure it only fetched projects with 
    complete marked as FALSE. I also wrote a route to fetch all completed projects, 
    which is unused at this point from the front-end, but will be coming shortly.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Apr. 1, 2018</h2>
  <p>This past week I added many test cases/scenarios to the Testing section
    of this progress site. The majority of our tests will be user driven since
    this is a very user driven project. The other big thing will be making sure
    all of our functionality properly updates and pulls from the MySQL database.
    We need to thoroughly test this since we have just finished migrating from 
    MongoDB to MySQL. This week, I also worked on the new user route to now
    send the registering user a confirmation email to let them know the signup
    was successful and so they know they must have an admin to approve and 
    authenticate them. I also started on two new routes for the users for the 
    reset password functionality. The first is called after the user clicks on
    the forgot password link and then generates a key and sends the user an 
    email containing the key. They are redirected to a page asking for the key
    and for a new password and to confirm the new password. The second route
    I worked on this week is called after the submit button is pressed on this
    new page. This route checks that the password reset key is valid and was
    generated within the past 24 hours, if so, then it updates the password in 
    the user table and removes the row containing the key from the table. This
    will allow the user to log in to Wallchart with their new password. This
    second route is still incomplete. I will need to add a new table called reset 
    to the MySQL database in order for these two new routes to work properly.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Mar. 24, 2018</h2>
  <p>Last week was spring break, so we did not work on the project. This past
    week we continued MySQL migration of the back-end of the project. I changed
    the project update route to now update projects' information in the SQL 
    database using a SQL query (as oppposed to MongoDB like it used to be). 
    I also modified the routes to authenticate users and delete users to also 
    now use MySQL by performing SQL queries. These basic yet crucial functionalities 
    will now work with our new tech stack. One important thing I had to learn was how 
    to use the MySQL package with Node and Express in order to prevent SQL injection. 
    For me, this took a bit to get used to and to understand, but it is no doubt 
    an important precaution to take. The package lets you use an array of 
    parameters to hold the information to be updated so the SQL query in 
    the code contains a '?' character in place of the actual project/user 
    information. This proved to shorten the query's string length and also 
    made the code more readable.</p>

  <h2>Mar. 11, 2018</h2>
  <p>This past week was midterms, so not a whole lot got accomplished for the 
    project. Toyota confirmed that we could use MySQL for the database so we 
    all have started trying to find ways to use our existing source code but 
    with a new database. In addition to this, I also created the slides and 
    content that I was to cover during the midterm presentation to the class.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Mar. 4, 2018</h2>
  <p>We met with Toyota this past week and were told we would need to change
    our database. This will mean our project's front-end progress has stopped
    and we are all hands on deck on migrating to a different database. Toyota
    gave us a choice between MS SQL (greatly preferred), MySQL, and PostreSQL. 
    We have come to a mutual decision that MySQL will likely be the best option 
    because three team members (myself included) will not be able to locally 
    run the version of the MS SQL server Toyota uses, due to having Macbooks.
    We still need to get the go-ahead from our customer contact, we were unable
    to have our weekly meet with him this past Thursday because he was out sick.
    Beyond researching our database options and how to migrate our project to 
    a new one, I also began to update the user scenarios section for this 
    progress site. I also added some of the nodemailer package functionality 
    in order to send registering users a confirmation email. This feature's 
    progress has now been temporarily halted because of the database issue.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 25, 2018</h2>
  <p>Updated mongodb database populater script to create a dummy 'teams'
    collection of data. This means there are now four separate collections.
    I also updated this script to add a few more necessary attributes to each 
    of the collection types in the database. This week I also completed the 
    effort and size estimation for this progress site as defined for the 
    requirements section of the final report. Lastly, I began research on the
    user password reset functionality for the project. This includes researching 
    and looking at examples of two popular node.js packages-- sendemail and 
    nodemailer. One of these should provide the functionality we seek.</p> 
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 18, 2018</h2>
  <p>Completed Ruby script to populate the mongodb database with arbitrary
    data consisting of three collections-- projects, columns, and users. With
    the project collection consisting of 20 randomized project documents, the 
    columns collection having the three standard columns for the chart, and two
    users. This will allow us to easily create the database for testing locally
    on any of the team members' or customers' machines. This will also allow us
    to test varying the amount of projects, columns, and users to ensure this 
    functionality works. I also started to update the Effort and size estimation,
    Schedule and milestones, and Platforms, tools, and languages sections of the 
    requirements page for the project progress website.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 8, 2018</h2>
  <p>I worked on a Ruby script to populate the mongodb database with random
    projects and their data. This will be useful for testing the tool to ensure
    the back-end and front-end are communicating properly with the project data, 
    since we do not have any users to create/update projects.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Feb. 7, 2018</h2>
  <p>I updated this progress site's introduction and requirements pages. This includes
    the introduction to the project and the requirements listed in priority order based
    on the necessary requirements provided on the course web page.</p>
