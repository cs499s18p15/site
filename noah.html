  <p>I worked on a Ruby script to populate the mongodb database with random
    projects and their data. This will be useful for testing the tool to ensure
    the back-end and front-end are communicating properly with the project data, 
    since we do not have any users to create/update projects.</p>

  <h2>Feb. 7, 2018</h2>
  <p>I updated this progress site's introduction and requirements pages. This includes
    the introduction to the project and the requirements listed in priority order based
    on the necessary requirements provided on the course web page.</p>
