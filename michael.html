  <h1>Michael's Weekly Updates</h1><br>

  <h2> March 4th, 2018 </h2>
  <p> This past week we met with Toyota at their facilities on Tuesday. We demonstrated the current user scrum tool and got user feedback.
      They liked what we have so far, but wanted to note specific requirements that were new. They requested the ability to search projects
      completion date and group. They also wanted the ability to measure projects by cost, quality, and timing. It was great to see the users
      using the proof of concept. We found out that Toyota does not support no SQL databases. So we need to migrate our data to mySQL. It will
      be a bit challenging. I suggested to our customer that we create a dev enviorment at their facility and train them how to pull from our master
      branch so that they could test and give us feedback. I returned to Toyota last Friday and spent 5 hours getting the dev enviorment setup and running
      and I learned that their boards show our user interface differently than expected. It should appear vertically, but it shows up horizontally.
      I'm not exactly sure why yet, but with more user testing it will become apparent.

  <h2>Feb. 22, 2018 </h2>
  <p> We met at our weekly scrum meeting. I updated our calendar for the website and helped divide the new work for this sprint between the team.
      I will be working on updating the login page and the registration page so it looks nicer. I am working on HTML tutorials so I can the wallchart
      tool a nice feel to the users We have set a meeting for next week at Toyota so that our end users can view our proof of concept and give us feedback.
      I will be driving Evan and Noah to the onsite meeting next Tuesday and I spoke with our customers about joining their weekly wallcahrt. We recieved approval
      and will be able to see some of the wallchart meeting to better understand how the customers will utilize the new scrum tool.</p>

  <p>I met with Evan today and learned how to pull the repo for our class project to update the website, and update my weekly contributions.
