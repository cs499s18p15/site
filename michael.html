  <h1>Michael's Weekly Updates</h1><br>

  <h2> March 24th, 2018 </h2>
  <p> I setup a new mySQL Databse for the team using Xampp, and wrote the schema for the database. I got feedback from Evan on the schema
      and worked to improve it for the backend. It may need a couple more tables when we go to add newer functionality. Currently we are migrating
      the old Mongo database to the new mySQL database, and once compelte I will be going to Toyota to update their dev server. Then they will be able
      to test the code on site and see how it works for the users. It will be great for feedback!
  </p>

  <h2> March 20th, 2018 </h2>
  <p> I have confimred a meeting for this Thursday with Troy and Toyota. I also have installed an upadated path to Python for my mySQL,
      and I have installed mySQL. I am working on getting the database confirgured and creaing a .sql file to automate database creation
      and fill with dummy data for our team to work with.

  <h2> March 18th, 2018 </h2>
  <p> I spent my week on spring break with limited internet connection and communication. I did contact Troy from Toyota and setup
      a group meeting for this coming Thursday. I will be working on setting up a new mySQL Database for the team and a schema so we
      can start fixing our backend system.

  <h2> March 11th, 2018 </h2>
  <p> This week was exam week and I spent most of my time preparing for exams. I also looked into the issue with our website showing
      up with horizonal bars instead of vertical bars on Toyota's user interface. From my inquriry it appears that the issue is related
      either to the version of Microsoft Edge or the hardware itself, but it still needs more iquiry to determine the root cause.

  <h2> March 4th, 2018 </h2>
  <p> This past week we met with Toyota at their facilities on Tuesday. We demonstrated the current user scrum tool and got user feedback.
      They liked what we have so far, but wanted to note specific requirements that were new. They requested the ability to search projects
      completion date and group. They also wanted the ability to measure projects by cost, quality, and timing. It was great to see the users
      using the proof of concept. We found out that Toyota does not support no SQL databases. So we need to migrate our data to mySQL. It will
      be a bit challenging. I suggested to our customer that we create a dev enviorment at their facility and train them how to pull from our master
      branch so that they could test and give us feedback. I returned to Toyota last Friday and spent 5 hours getting the dev enviorment setup and running
      and I learned that their boards show our user interface differently than expected. It should appear vertically, but it shows up horizontally.
      I'm not exactly sure why yet, but with more user testing it will become apparent.

  <h2>Feb. 22, 2018 </h2>
  <p> We met at our weekly scrum meeting. I updated our calendar for the website and helped divide the new work for this sprint between the team.
      I will be working on updating the login page and the registration page so it looks nicer. I am working on HTML tutorials so I can the wallchart
      tool a nice feel to the users We have set a meeting for next week at Toyota so that our end users can view our proof of concept and give us feedback.
      I will be driving Evan and Noah to the onsite meeting next Tuesday and I spoke with our customers about joining their weekly wallcahrt. We recieved approval
      and will be able to see some of the wallchart meeting to better understand how the customers will utilize the new scrum tool.</p>

  <h2>Feb. 16, 2018</h2>
  <p>I met with Evan today and learned how to pull the repo for our class project to update the website, and update my weekly contributions.
     Also learning how to setup mongo Database and doing Vue tutorials online so I can contribute to front end development.
     Added to my mongo database new users and a admin user so I can view the different pages. Got Node server installed onto my pc and got it up
     and running.</p>
