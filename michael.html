  <h1>Michael's Weekly Updates</h1><br>

  <h2>Feb. 16, 2018</h2>
  <p>I met with Evan today and learned how to pull the repo for our class project to update the website, and update my weekly contributions.
     Also learning how to setup mongo Database and doing Vue tutorials online so I can contribute to front end development.</p>
