  <h1>Michael's Weekly Updates</h1><br>

  <h2>Feb. 16, 2018</h2>
  <p>I met with Evan today and learned how to pull the repo for our class project to update the website, and update my weekly contributions.
     Also learning how to setup mongo Database and doing Vue tutorials online so I can contribute to front end development.</p>

  <h3>Feb. 22, 2018 </h2>
  <p> We met at our weekly scrum meeting. I updated our calendar for the website and helped divide the new work for this sprint between the team.
      I will be working on updating the login page and the registration page so it looks nicer. I am working on HTML tutorials so I can the wallchart
      tool a nice feel to the users. </p>
