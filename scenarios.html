      <h1>User Scenarios</h1>
      		<br>
			<h3>New user</h2>
			<p>1. The user goes to the wallchart site and is prompted to either register or log in.</p>
			<p>2. Since the user does not have an account they sign up.</p>
			<p>3. The user will fill out the form providing contact information and whether they are
				requesting access as a team member or administrator/manager.</p>
			<p>4. The user will receive a confirmation email and will confirm their account. An administrator
				or super administrator can grant confirmation or confirm another administrator account.</p>
			<p>5. After this account creation, the user can now sign back in and be a confirmed, registered user
				and start using the wallchart tool. If this new user is an administrator, they will have access
				to the admin page and be able to view all their team members.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Returning 'normal' user</h3>
			<p>1. The user will be prompted to sign in (or register for a new account if they happen wish 
				to do so), unless their token is not yet expired (in that case they should be logged
				in automatically).</p>
			<p>2. The normal team member user can have access to the wallchart tool. They are able to view
				all projects that are currently in progress, but only to move and edit the projects to 
				which they are assigned. They can change the status or update several types of descriptions 
				of their projects. They can also see real time updates for all other users signed in to
				the wallchart tool.</p>
			<p>3. After viewing/making edits, the user can sign out and feel confident their changes are
				saved and available for next time.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Returning administrator user</h3>
			<p>1. The user will be prompted to sign in (or register for a new account if they happen wish 
				to do so), unless their token is not yet expired (in that case they should be logged
				in automatically).</p>
			<p>2. This admin user will have access to both the normal wallchart tool page, and also the
				administrator page, where they can see unconfirmed users, confirmed users, as well
				as the other administrators.</p>
			<p>3. The administrator user is able to confirm other not-yet-confirmed users of the wallchart
				tool. This will ensure that these are not fraudulent users.</p>
			<p>4. The administrator user can also, on the wallchart tool page, move not only projects that
				they, themselves, are directly working on, but all projects in the area or group that
				they oversee as managers.</p>
			<p>5. After viewing/making changes to either the wallchart or admin page, the admin user can 
				sign out and feel confident their changes are saved and available for next time.</p>
