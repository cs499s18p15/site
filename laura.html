	<p>This week, I've been working on coding routers, which is something I've never done before. Between a lot of research and even more help from Evan, I was able to get a basic User router that gets and stores user data, authenticates users, and logs users into the site. I also made a router that stored the information about columns for the website, so that users can create new columns if necessary, and the column information is stored better.</p><br>
