	<h1> Laura's Weekly Updates</h1><br>
  <h2>April 19 - 25, 2018</h2>
  <p>This week, we finalized our presentation and were able to present on Monday to our class and our Product Owner. He was very complimentary of our work, and told us multiple times that we "Crushed it", which was nice to hear. He also took a picture with us and wished us luck on the rest of our endevors. After that, the whole week has been focused on finalizing our website and finishing up code comments. We have our final meeting with our professor coming up, and I believe it will go well. Overall, this has been a great project to work on. We've learned so much about working with a company and working on a large scale project with many things available and incredibly open options. Usually, when working on a project for a class, you are expected to use the techniques and laguages that you have been learning in that class, but here we had the freedom to find what we believed would work best and deal with the consiquences, good or bad, of those choices.</p><br>
  <h2>April 12 - 18, 2018</h2>
  <p>Now that the end is quickly approaching, all I have been doing is adding comments to code. There's a system to it now, which is nice, so readability should be in a much better place than it was. It also makes the process of writing the comments much faster. This coming week, we have our final presentation, which should also be fun. While I'm not a huge fan of public speaking, I am excited to get to show off our product and how much we've been able to accomplish this semester. I can honestly say that I will miss working with this team of guys. I've learned a lot from them, and they've all been very helpful and entertaining and just generally fun to be around. This semester has really kind of brought home for me the reason I like software engineering so much. It's because I really like sitting around with a couple likeminded people and working on a project at the same time. It's nice to be able to bounce ideas back and fourth in such an efficient way. It's been really pleasant having my feelings about it be reaffirmed while working on projects this semester.</p><br>
  <h2>April 5 - 11, 2018</h2>
  <p>This week, we were able to go up to Georgetown again to download our newest updates to the server. We ended up spending five hours making sure everything was correctly downloaded to their testing server and their official server, and we worked on small fixes while we waited on our downloads. We were also able to pull up the wallchart screen on the Windows Surface Hub that they will actually be using in meetings, and we were able to test and make sure that everything was usable on that software. Luckily, it wasm so no fixes were needed. We updated a couple things in the database as well, and got about five more suggestions of things to add in the next week. We informed them that we have a very limited time, but we will attempt to impliment whatever we can. I personally am working on adding comments to all of the routes files at the moment to increase readability and easy understanding. So far, it has not been incredibly difficult, and I hope to get it done part way through the next week.</p><br>
  <h2>March 29-April 4, 2018</h2>
  <p>This week, I have been working on rewriting parts of the projects route. We are making it so the Project Owner is a drop-down list of the users, so whomever is changing it does not have to know the name of every user in the database. The downside of all of this is that I had already written it to accept the username when typed, which made me rewrite a lot of the project route to begin with. Using a drop down system makes it so I could have just used the old route. So now I'm going back and undoing all my changes to the router, which is given an extra challenge, because I do not completely remember what was changed and what was not. So, at the moment, it has been mostly commenting out sections to see which ones lead me in the right direction without breaking everything all at once. Hopefully, I can get it done before we go back to Toyota on Thursday to update their product and to show them everything in it's relatively final state. We are also getting a card for our specific product owner, Troy, as a thank you for being so readily available and easy to talk to.</p><br>
  <h2>March 22-28, 2018</h2>
  <p>This week, I was able to get the projects route where we wanted it by adding the add and delete routes. The add route made ti so that we could create new projects from the wallchart page. The route is given the project name, the team that the project belongs to, and the column that the project is located in. It then takes this information, makes a basic project with an empty description and base "cost" "quality" and "time" values, and stores it in the database so it can be called an further edited. It also generates a project ID, which is then sent back to the front end. The delete route takes the project given by the project ID an ddeletes it from the database. The interesting part of all of these routes, from my perspective, is that I have never written in MySql before. From this very basic experience, I believe that MySql doesn't seem that complex, and it reads rather like engish, which I found useful. Michael went up to Toyota and downloaded the current version of the site onto one of their computers so they could begin testing and giving us feedback. He returned with a list of priorities, which we have yet to divvy up amonst ourselves. That will be our focus for the next week. Our goal is to be finished soon, so that we can focus on cleaning up documentation and making sure our codes comments are readable for whomever may take over this project in the next semester.</p><br>
  <h2>March 15-21, 2018</h2>
  <p>After finally getting back from three straight weeks of basketball, I was able to meet up with my team in person, which was very refreshing. We reviewed everything that had been changed during our database switch-over, and how set back we still currently were. After a bit of discussion, we decided that the main focus was to get our back end up to where we needed it. Michael was given the task of finishing up the front end HTML stuff that I had been working on previously, and I was given a couple routers to edit over the next week. It's nice to see the progress we have been making in spite of the database setback a couple weeks ago. Not to mention, even though we swithed to MySql, which is different from the Mongo database we were using, it's nice to be working on routers again. I feel like I'm working on something that I'm not learning completely from scratch, which is a nice change of pace so far. We're hoping to have the database caught up in the next couple of weeks so our customers can take a look at it and begin testing it on site, in order to find major problems for us to fix before the end of the semester.</p><br>
	<h2>March 8-14, 2018</h2>
	<p>This week was Spring Break, which would imply that I would have more time to work on the project. However, I spent spring break in Boise, Idaho with the mens basketball team, which means that my week was full of pep rallies and basketball games. I did get some spare hours to run my design over with Evan. After figuring out what needs to be written on the homepage, I can hopefully finish up the implementation this week. We decided on roughly three paragraphs, divided in different points on the screen. I think I am going to go with a blue and grey color scheme. Although Toyota itself favors the color red, our project is created at UK. If they would prefer red, it would be an easy change anyway. Other than that, I looked into Bootstrap a bit more to make sure I had a good understanding of how to use it when I actually start coding. Hopefully, this next week will be more productive. As I have said multiple times, The last few weeks have been overrun with basketball responsibilities. The next week could be as well, depending on the outcome of the sweet sixteen.</p><br>
	<h2>March 1-7, 2018</h2>
	<p>At the beginning of this week, the four of us drove up to Georgetown to meet with our customers face to face in order to get better feedback, and to install our site onto one of their company modules, so they could begin on-site testing. I, unfortunately, due to unforeseen traffic mishaps, was late to our meeting. Luckily, they were all very forgiving, and I got to meet everyone briefly before they went on to do their own work. Then, our small group and our Product Manager stayed in the meeting room to discuss major changes. The most major of which was the database issue. Their company does not support the database that we were using, which was Mongo. So, the next few weeks will be focused on switching everything in the back end over to Sequel. Luckily, Michael has experience with Sequel, so hopefully that will give us a little bit of an upper hand while tackling this particular speed bump. We then stayed for an hour and a half and casually talked about things while attempting to set up everything on one of their computers. Unfortunately, everything was downloading rather slow, and then not loading at all, so we decided to have a couple members return in a couple days to finish setting everything up so the rest of us could return home before eleven. I then, two days later, hopped on a bus and rode to Nashville for the Womenâ€™s SEC Tournament, which took up a lot of my time for three days. I had my laptop with me, and was able to call my group during our weekly meeting to discuss our plans for the next week, and to  go over our slides for the next weeks presentation. While I would have preferred to do this in person, and not in a hotel room, it was good that I was able to participate in the meeting.</p><br>
	<h2>February 22-28, 2018</h2>
	<p>This week I have been doing the opposite of what I normally do. Up until now, Iâ€™ve been working on the back end of everything on the website. This week, I was given a spot on the front end. I am going to come up with an effective design for the homepage. So far, this week has been mostly coming up with a design and learning HTML. I have never use HTML before, other than doing these updates, but that is not very intensive, so I do not really consider that effective practice. So, as soon as I am able to understand what is within reason and what would be appropriate for the website, I will be able to start on the homepage. So far, the most difficult part is deciding what the homepage should look like. There is not a lot that needs to be on it, so it mostly needs to be aesthetically pleasing. I have spent most of the week looking at examples online to try and spark any creativity. I think I might do a large image with a greeting message or a title in the middle. Something simple, but more complex than just a white screen with black letters, which is what we currently have. </p><br>
	<h2>February 15-21, 2018</h2>
	<p>This week I continued working on routers. I was able to finish up the Teams router, which created and stored Team data, so only teams can edit their own information. After my previous weekâ€™s experience with routers, it made this week go by a lot smoother. I was able to create an organized router in a couple days, and then discuss further alterations to previous routers during the rest of the week. We added connections to the teams router and the users router so managers can be assigned to teams. I scheduled our room for our weekly meeting with our Product Manager, and helped pass the information along to the rest of the group. Our meeting went well, and we were able to show off our updated version of the site using Google Hangout, so that we could get instant feedback from our Product Manager. He is always very understanding of our time constraints, and he explains the reasoning behind his changes, so we can more efficiently come up with appropriate solutions. This week, one of his big points was having larger columns that fill up more of the screen so more projects would be visible at a time. This will mean that our project view window will need to be implemented differently than we had originally planned.</p><br>
	<h2>February 8-14, 2018</h2>
	<p>This week, I've been working on coding routers, which is something I've never done before. Between a lot of research and even more help from Evan, I was able to get a basic User router that gets and stores user data, authenticates users, and logs users into the site. I also made a router that stored the information about columns for the website, so that users can create new columns if necessary, and the column information is stored better. Luckily, Evan had already written a route for projects that I could use as an example, which helped me understand how a route is supposed to be formatted. I was able to find tutorials and examples online to determine what would be needed in the routes I was creating. I was able to create a basic design that outlined what each router needed to store, and then how to store it. In order to organize everything better, I was able to find a plugin for node machine that created random IDâ€™s that I could assign to users, and columns. I was also able to find a plugin that hashed the password given at the login so we could store the hashed password versus the actual password, which is considerably safer. After creating all these routes, I learned how to push them to the GitHub repository. The biggest challenge this week was learning how to make routers correctly. Not only have I near coded in Javascript, but I have never taken a database class, so my understanding of them was very theoretical. Luckily, I had a lot of help from my team and was able to learn a lot this week.</p><br>
	<h2>February 1-7, 2018</h2>
	<p>During this first week, we were able to meet with our customer and begin discussing the important requirements for our wallchart tool. The goal for this first week was to make sure that we were all able to pull from our groups GitHub repository, which we were all able to, and we all made sure we were able to communicate and meet on a weekly basis, so we could all stay on top of our responsibilities. Personally, I mostly focused on making sure I was connected to everything we had decided to use on the project, and that I had downloaded all of the necessary tools. Once they were correctly installed, I was able to pull up the website from my own terminal. The biggest struggle during this week was my laptop. I found out about a week into the semester that my laptop was not letting me power it on, and, according to the Apple store, it was going to take hundreds of dollars to fix, which I didnâ€™t have. My solution was to do as much as I could on school computers, which would have set me back significantly on this project. Luckily, after letting my stepfather take a closer look at my laptop, he was able to determine a cheaper fix that cost me less than a hundred dollars, and had my computer back up and running in less than a week. I was then able to download the necessary packages and, after letting Evan give it a once over, I had everything ready to go to start my part of the project.</p><br>
