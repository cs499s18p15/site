	<h1> Laura's Weekly Updates</h1><br>
	<h2>February 15-21, 2018</h2>
	<p>This week I continued working on routers. I was able to finish up the Teams router, which created and stored Team data, so only teams can edit their own information.</p>
	<h2>February 8-14, 2018</h2>
	<p>This week, I've been working on coding routers, which is something I've never done before. Between a lot of research and even more help from Evan, I was able to get a basic User router that gets and stores user data, authenticates users, and logs users into the site. I also made a router that stored the information about columns for the website, so that users can create new columns if necessary, and the column information is stored better.</p><br>
	<h2>February 1-7, 2018</h2>
	<p>During this first week, we were able to meet with our customer and begin discussing the important requirements for our wallchart tool. The goal for this first week was to make sure that we were all able to pull from our groups GitHub repository, which we were all able to, and we all made sure we were able to communicate and meet on a weekly basis, so we could all stay on top of our responsibilities. Personally, I mostly focused on making sure I was connected to everything we had decided to use on the project, and that I had downloaded all of the necessary tools. Once they were correctly installed, I was able to pull up the website from my own terminal.</p>
