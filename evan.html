    <p>The app now loads the position of projects from the database on startup. Additionally, moving projects from column to column will send requests to the backend and update the project positions accordingly in MongoDB. This means that the location of projects is persistent across all users, and on page refresh. Note: real-time updating has yet to be implemented.</p>

    <h2>Feb. 13, 2018</h2>
    <p>Implemented the use of JWTs for user authentication. The server is capable of signing JWTs, which are sent to users upon login. The user will then attach the JWT with any future requests he makes to the server. The server can then decode the token to know exactly who made the given request, whether they have appropriate permissions, etc.</p>

    <p>Added vue-router to the project. This will allow us to host multiple pages as self-contained Vue components.</p>

    <p>Now using vue-draggable library for drag&drop functionality on project sticky notes. Unfortunately, I'm forced to set up the data in a way that will make it hard to send discrete /move events to the backend. Need to do more research on how to get proper event data.</p>

    <p>Added mongodb into the mix. We can now write routes in the backend that query from a database.</p>

    <p>Set up the project using vue-cli. We now have a functional Vue.js frontend and a node.js & express backend.</p>
