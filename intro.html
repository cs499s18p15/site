  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
  <ul style="text-align:center;"> 
    <li>
      <p>This project is tentatively dubbed the "Wallchart Tool" with
        the alternate subtitle "Toyota Scrum Tools." The feature being
        supplied to the customer is an interactive web application
        that tracks the progress of projects through the Scrum project
        lifecycle. This is especially important for higher level executives
        in the company to be able to track the progress of their projects
        without necessarily calling a full meeting with a very busy team.

      <p>This project aims to provide online Scrum project tracking for 
        Toyota team members. This solution will allow for better 
        communication between teams and management. The "wallchart tool" 
        will also allow for deeper collaboration with remote team members.
